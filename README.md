## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In this data analysis report I will investigate what this data hints about the reasons why millions of Americans do not vote. I believe that this is a particularly interesting subject because it is particularly relevant, and I will be able to see how this data compares to the voters turn out in the November 2020 election. Everyone in America seems to have strong opinions on politics however millions of people do not vote, I would be very interested in understanding how that happens. I am particularly interested in seeing if the average number of people who responded to this survey saying that they do not vote reflects in the number of people who actually did not vote in the upcoming election. I want to see if I can infer different correlations such has liking a certain candidate and the likelihood to turn up at the polls, the effect of COVID-19 on voters turn out and mistrust in the voting system. I think that a dashboard that compiles all those different factors would be of great interest and I am excited to build it.

This data was gathered by fivethirtyeight.com in the public interest to understand why some many Americans do not vote in the perspective of the November 2020 presidential election, this data gathering was spontaneous and not ordered by any governmental agency. There were 8,327 participants who enrolled in this study, they were all American citizens eligible to vote in the upcoming 2020 election on November 3rd, the organization thrived to reflect the diversity of the American population however, do to the nature of this survey (online survey) young people are overrepresented in this data. Participants were polled on a diversity of questions: their identity as an American, the importance of voting to them, their trust in the voting system, the different administrative barriered to voting, their health and a series of questions that particularly apply to the 2020 election. This data was crossed checked with American voter files to confirm that those individuals existing in the eyes of the American voting system, 5,239 of the participants were able to be cross referenced. However, there is no guarantee that the participant were telling the truth or that their answers were not influenced by societal pressures.
