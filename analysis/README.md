# Where do I find what?
scripts/load_functions contains the function that clean the data and make it more readable 
analysis/milestone2 contains the data analysis (exploration + explained analysis)

# Limitations and bugs 

Milestone2.py generates a "file not found execption" 1/3 of the time caused to error in chaining. If you encounter this error you can use test.py to see the analysis as this file works 100% of the time. 

Enjoy!
